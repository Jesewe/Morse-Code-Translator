### Morse Code Translator
The Morse Code Translator is a program that accepts text entered by the user and translates it into Morse code, replacing letters with their corresponding characters. The program uses dictionaries to translate letters into Morse code. Depending on the selected language, the program selects the appropriate dictionary. Russian Russian uses a dictionary containing the encoding of English letters and numbers, and for the Russian language - a dictionary with the encoding of Russian letters and numbers.

Here's an example of how the program works:
```
Select a language: English (eng) or Русский (rus)? eng
Enter the text: Hello, World!
Morse code text: .... . .-.. .-.. --- --..-- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--
```
